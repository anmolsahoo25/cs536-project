abstract = {Memory access is the major bottleneck in realizing multi-hundred-gigabit networks with commodity hardware, hence it is essential to make good use of cache memory that is a faster, but smaller memory closer to the processor. Our goal is to study the impact of cache management on the performance of I/O intensive applications. Specifically, this paper looks at one of the bottlenecks in packet processing, i.e., direct cache access (DCA). We systematically studied the current implementation of DCA in Intel® processors, particularly Data Direct I/O technology (DDIO), which directly transfers data between I/O devices and the processor's cache. Our empirical study enables system designers/developers to optimize DDIO-enabled systems for I/O intensive applications. We demonstrate that optimizing DDIO could reduce the latency of I/O intensive network functions running at 100 Gbps by up to ∼30\%. Moreover, we show that DDIO causes a 30\% increase in tail latencies when processing packets at 200 Gbps, hence it is crucial to selectively inject data into the cache or to explicitly bypass it.},
